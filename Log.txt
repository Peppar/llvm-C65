Got this error while debugging my tablegen files:

llvm-tblgen: /home/peppar/clang/llvm/utils/TableGen/CodeGenDAGPatterns.h:646: llvm::Record *llvm::DAGInstruction::getResult(unsigned int) const: Assertion `RN < Results.size()' failed.



/home/peppar/clang/llvm/lib/Target/C65/C65InstrInfo.td:183:5: error: In ASLa: Could not infer all types in pattern!

Changed the immediate 1 to (i8 i)... Don't really know what this will yield..!


Added C65 to these files
  /home/peppar/clang/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/Triple.h
  /home/peppar/clang/llvm/lib/Support/Triple.cpp
